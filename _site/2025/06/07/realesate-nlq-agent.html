I mean we all know the drill right, It’s just too much dropdowns, rigid filters, and somehow we still end up scrolling through properties that miss the mark completely. Want a “family-friendly home near good schools”? Good luck translating that into checkboxes and price sliders. I mean imagine there is a system which can just translate these queries to something meaningful reference and give us better results.</p><p>Taking into that account, I created an agentic Natural Language Querying (NLQ) system that actually understands what people want. Just tell it “Find me a 3-bedroom home in Toronto under $600,000 with 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms” and it figures out the rest. I mean this is one of the coolest thing right..</p><p>Here’s how I combined vector search with AI agents to create a real estate assistant that actually gets it. If you want to follow along, refer to this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UNOtum5ngDSm6Jj1dp6qpFe5mStqdgGb?usp=sharing">colab</a></p><p><img src="https://github.com/vipul-maheshwari/vipul-maheshwari.github.io/blob/main/images/real-estate-nlq-agent/title_image.png?raw=true" alt="title_image" /></p><h2 id="the-problem-with-current-real-estate-search">The Problem with Current Real Estate Search</h2><p>Every real estate platform treats search like you’re querying a database. It’s all structured filters and rigid categories. Need a family home at a place? Here’s your homework:</p><ul><li>Pick a price range from a dropdown</li><li>Select bedrooms and bathrooms</li><li>Choose your city from a list</li><li>Cross your fingers that “good schools” somehow correlates with your selected neighborhood</li></ul><p>This approach fails because real estate decisions are nuanced as hell. It’s super hard to translate the relevant requirements to the dropdowns and rigid filters. When someone says “affordable family home,” they could mean totally different things based on their income, family size, and what they consider “affordable.” I mean we need something where we can just put out the queries and get the relevant results. That’s where NLQ comes into play.</p><h2 id="whats-natural-language-querying-all-about">What’s Natural Language Querying All About?</h2><p>NLQ flips the script. Instead of forcing users to translate their thoughts into database queries, it lets them just… talk normally.</p><p><strong>Old way</strong>: <code>Price: $400K-$600K, Bedrooms: 3+, Location: Toronto</code></p><p><strong>New way</strong>: <code>"Find me a 3-bedroom home in Toronto under $600,000"</code></p><p>The system handles the translation from human language to structured queries while actually understanding context and intent.</p><h2 id="what-it-took-to-made-it">What it took to made it..</h2><p>Well there are couple of the different components that I glued together which provides NLQ capabilities, semantic search, and contextual reasoning.</p><ul><li><strong>Superlinked</strong>: Well this is the most important aspect of making this happen, I mean this is the one which provides the core vector search and NLQ interfaces for retrieving relevant results based on user queries.</li><li><strong>LLM</strong>: Well for this project, I used OpenAI GPT-4 which powers both the intent classification and generative outputs such as recommendations, insight narratives, and query reformulations.</li><li>For the embedding generation I used <code>sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2</code></li></ul><p>You can use any LLM or any embedding model of your choice based on the requirements.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/vipul-maheshwari/vipul-maheshwari.github.io/blob/main/images/real-estate-nlq-agent/nlq_only_architecture.png?raw=true" alt="nlq_only_architecture" /></p><h2 id="data-requirements">Data Requirements</h2><p>To demonstrate how the NLQ system and agentic flow work in practice, I used a dataset that reflects what you’d typically find in real-world property listings. This includes property-level attributes like price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and address, along with geographic fields such as city and province.</p><p>To support more context-aware reasoning, the data also includes demographic details like population size and median household income—useful for queries that imply lifestyle or investment considerations.</p><h2 id="how-i-built-this-thing">How I Built This Thing</h2><h3 id="step-1-vector-spaces-for-property-magic">Step 1: Vector Spaces for Property Magic</h3><p>I created specialised vector spaces for different property characteristics.

</code></pre><p>Why vector spaces? They enable fuzzy matching, so when someone searches “near downtown” the system intelligently finds relevant addresses without needing exact geolocation data. Numerical spaces compare property details like price, bedrooms, bathrooms, population, and income, prioritising user preferences. Categorical spaces ensure precise matching for cities and provinces, filtering out irrelevant locations. It’s all about semantic understanding and flexible, accurate comparisons.</p><h3 id="step-2-weighted-query-construction">Step 2: Weighted Query Construction</h3><p>Weighted queries prioritize what matters most in searches. As weights defines how much importance that parameter have when we fetch the relevant results. Higher weights, like for price, ensure results match user priorities, like sticking to a budget.</p><pre><code class="language-python">query = sl.Query(index, weights={
    address_space: sl.Param("address_weight", default=1.0),
    price_space: sl.Param("price_weight", default=100.0),
    city_space: sl.Param("city_weight", default=1.0),
    beds_space: sl.Param("beds_weight", default=1.0),
    baths_space: sl.Param("baths_weight", default=1.0),
    population_space: sl.Param("population_weight", default=0.2),
    income_space: sl.Param("income_weight", default=1.0),
})

</code></pre><p>Notice price gets 100x weight? That’s because budget is usually the make-or-break factor. No point showing someone a $2M mansion when they said “affordable.” Crazy laugh here…</p><h3 id="why-agents--nlq-for-real-estate-search">Why Agents + NLQ for Real Estate Search?</h3><p>Before we get into the tools and how they simplify everything, let’s take a quick look at why pairing agents with Natural Language Querying (NLQ) leads to such a powerful search experience.</p><ol><li><p><strong>NLQ helps machines speak our language.</strong></p><p>When someone says, “affordable family homes under $250,000,” NLQ knows how to break that down into structured search parameters and get the relevant results for us.</p></li><li><p><strong>But on its own, NLQ hits a ceiling.</strong></p><p>Sure, it’s great at filtering by the criteria as I mention, but it tends to fall short when:</p><ul><li>The results are too few or too literal, without understanding the intent behind the query.</li><li>You’re looking for personalised suggestions that go beyond the filters. I mean just think when you have let’s say 10 different properties which are completing your criteria but you still need some kind of personalised recommendations.</li><li>You want to compare multiple results in context.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>That’s where agents step in.</strong></p><p>Agents bring reasoning to the table. They can:</p><ul><li>Recognise when a search is too narrow and offer smarter alternatives.</li><li>Read between the lines and pick up on what the user might actually want. So instead of just throwing the results, we can utilize these agents to make more of those findings.</li><li>Handle more complex workflows—like comparing options or building narratives from raw data.</li></ul></li></ol><p>So when you blend NLQ (which listens and interprets) with agents (which think and act), you get something far more intelligent: a system that doesn’t just understand your request—it also knows how to respond meaningfully. That’s the sweet spot.</p><h3 id="step-3-the-agentic-layer---where-the-magic-happens">Step 3: The Agentic Layer - Where the Magic Happens</h3><p>Ok, Here’s where it starts to get fun. Rather than building a one-size-fits-all (and honestly, kind of dumb) search tool, I designed an agentic system made up of five specialised tools—each one kicks in based on what the user is actually trying to do.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/vipul-maheshwari/vipul-maheshwari.github.io/blob/main/images/real-estate-nlq-agent/agentic_only_architecture.png?raw=true" alt="agentic_only_architecture" /></p><pre><code class="language-python">class RealEstateAgent:

Insights for 'What's a good investment in Toronto?':

Market Overview:
The Toronto property market is characterized by an average property price of $577,158, with a median price slightly higher at $589,000. The price range for properties in the market spans from $415,000 to $695,000. The average property consists of approximately 1.6 bedrooms and 1.1 bathrooms.

Investment Potential:
Given the average income in Toronto is $97,000, the property prices indicate a relatively high cost of living. This presents an opportunity for investors as there is a substantial market for both property purchasing and rental if buying to let. The properties in Toronto have been ranked by our NLQ system based on price and other factors, giving a relevance score. This score indicates the property's potential for return on investment considering these factors.

Key Considerations:
The top-ranked property by our NLQ system is located at '#1808 -1 KING ST W' with a price of $415,000. This property has 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom and it is the most affordable among the top-ranked properties. Other good investment options include properties located at '#201 -115 RICHMOND ST E', '#1608 -101 ERSKINE AVE', '#906 -1190 DUNDAS ST E', and '#2009 -24 WELLESLEY ST W' with prices ranging from $479,000 to $599,000.

It is important for potential investors to consider the location of the property, as properties in certain neighborhoods may offer higher potential returns due to demand and price trends. It is also crucial to consider the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as these factors can affect both the rental income potential and the resale value.

   - Buyers with a higher budget and a preference for city living might find the properties in Toronto more attractive. These properties offer the convenience of city living, with easy access to amenities and are ideal for those who work in the city.
   - On the other hand, buyers looking for more affordable options, or those who prefer a quieter, suburban lifestyle might prefer the properties in Kitchener. These homes offer great value for money and could also be ideal for families with children, given the lower cost of living.
   - For investors, both cities could offer good opportunities depending on their strategy. Toronto's high property prices could lead to high rental income, while Kitchener's lower prices could result in higher yield.

So doing this end to end , we took care of a few core architectural choices that shaped how this system really works.</p><p>The most important one here is that I intentionally gave more weight to the Price rather than other filters when we were creating the query, as It acts as a hard constraint, while other attributes like location or amenities adjust the relevance within that boundary. I mean the Price is the most important factor I guess when we are looking out for the real estate.</p><p>And as I said earlier, our NLQ engine doesn’t depends on the structured filters, instead it understand the natural language directly.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2025-06-07T00:00:00+05:30">June 7, 2025</time></span></section><!-- --- layout: default ---<section class="post"><h2>Real Estate Natural Language Querying Agent</h2><p>Real estate search is straight-up broken. I mean we all know the drill right, It’s just too much dropdowns, rigid filters, and somehow we still end up scrolling through properties that miss the mark completely. Want a “family-friendly home near good schools”? Good luck translating that into checkboxes and price sliders. I mean imagine there is a system which can just translate these queries to something meaningful reference and give us better results.</p><p>Taking into that account, I created an agentic Natural Language Querying (NLQ) system that actually understands what people want. Just tell it “Find me a 3-bedroom home in Toronto under $600,000 with 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms” and it figures out the rest. I mean this is one of the coolest thing right..</p><p>Here’s how I combined vector search with AI agents to create a real estate assistant that actually gets it.

It’s all structured filters and rigid categories. Need a family home at a place? Here’s your homework:</p><ul><li>Pick a price range from a dropdown</li><li>Select bedrooms and bathrooms</li><li>Choose your city from a list</li><li>Cross your fingers that “good schools” somehow correlates with your selected neighborhood</li></ul><p>This approach fails because real estate decisions are nuanced as hell. It’s super hard to translate the relevant requirements to the dropdowns and rigid filters. When someone says “affordable family home,” they could mean totally different things based on their income, family size, and what they consider “affordable.” I mean we need something where we can just put out the queries and get the relevant results. That’s where NLQ comes into play.</p><h2 id="whats-natural-language-querying-all-about">What’s Natural Language Querying All About?</h2><p>NLQ flips the script.

</code></pre><p>Why vector spaces? They enable fuzzy matching, so when someone searches “near downtown” the system intelligently finds relevant addresses without needing exact geolocation data. Numerical spaces compare property details like price, bedrooms, bathrooms, population, and income, prioritising user preferences. Categorical spaces ensure precise matching for cities and provinces, filtering out irrelevant locations. It’s all about semantic understanding and flexible, accurate comparisons.</p><h3 id="step-2-weighted-query-construction">Step 2: Weighted Query Construction</h3><p>Weighted queries prioritize what matters most in searches. As weights defines how much importance that parameter have when we fetch the relevant results. Higher weights, like for price, ensure results match user priorities, like sticking to a budget.</p><pre><code class="language-python">query = sl.Query(index, weights={
    address_space: sl.Param("address_weight", default=1.0),

I mean just think when you have let’s say 10 different properties which are completing your criteria but you still need some kind of personalised recommendations.</li><li>You want to compare multiple results in context.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>That’s where agents step in.</strong></p><p>Agents bring reasoning to the table. They can:</p><ul><li>Recognise when a search is too narrow and offer smarter alternatives.</li><li>Read between the lines and pick up on what the user might actually want. So instead of just throwing the results, we can utilize these agents to make more of those findings.</li><li>Handle more complex workflows—like comparing options or building narratives from raw data.</li></ul></li></ol><p>So when you blend NLQ (which listens and interprets) with agents (which think and act), you get something far more intelligent: a system that doesn’t just understand your request—it also knows how to respond meaningfully. That’s the sweet spot.</p><h3 id="step-3-the-agentic-layer---where-the-magic-happens">Step 3: The Agentic Layer - Where the Magic Happens</h3><p>Ok, Here’s where it starts to get fun.

Insights for 'What's a good investment in Toronto?':

Market Overview:
The Toronto property market is characterized by an average property price of $577,158, with a median price slightly higher at $589,000. The price range for properties in the market spans from $415,000 to $695,000. The average property consists of approximately 1.6 bedrooms and 1.1 bathrooms.

Investment Potential:
Given the average income in Toronto is $97,000, the property prices indicate a relatively high cost of living. This presents an opportunity for investors as there is a substantial market for both property purchasing and rental if buying to let. The properties in Toronto have been ranked by our NLQ system based on price and other factors, giving a relevance score. This score indicates the property's potential for return on investment considering these factors.

Key Considerations:
The top-ranked property by our NLQ system is located at '#1808 -1 KING ST W' with a price of $415,000. This property has 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom and it is the most affordable among the top-ranked properties. Other good investment options include properties located at '#201 -115 RICHMOND ST E', '#1608 -101 ERSKINE AVE', '#906 -1190 DUNDAS ST E', and '#2009 -24 WELLESLEY ST W' with prices ranging from $479,000 to $599,000.

It is important for potential investors to consider the location of the property, as properties in certain neighborhoods may offer higher potential returns due to demand and price trends. It is also crucial to consider the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as these factors can affect both the rental income potential and the resale value.

So doing this end to end , we took care of a few core architectural choices that shaped how this system really works.</p><p>The most important one here is that I intentionally gave more weight to the Price rather than other filters when we were creating the query, as It acts as a hard constraint, while other attributes like location or amenities adjust the relevance within that boundary. I mean the Price is the most important factor I guess when we are looking out for the real estate.</p><p>And as I said earlier, our NLQ engine doesn’t depends on the structured filters, instead it understand the natural language directly.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2025-06-07T00:00:00+05:30">June 7, 2025</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/Agent">Agent</a>, <a href="/tag/Superlinked">Superlinked</a></span>--> <!--</section>--></main><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-JBZRCCYMBP"></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag() { dataLayer.push(arguments); } gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'G-JBZRCCYMBP'); </script></body></html>
